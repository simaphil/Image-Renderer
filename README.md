# Purpose
The primary objective of this project is to serve as an educational tool for students and developers to learn and apply:

Agile Development: Utilizing iterative and incremental approaches to manage software projects.
Test-Driven Development (TDD): Writing tests before coding to ensure functionality and improve code quality.
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Designing software using objects and classes to promote reusability and modularity.

# Features
Image Rendering: A core functionality to render and display images in a Java application.
Modular Design: Implementation of OOP principles to create a flexible and maintainable codebase.
Comprehensive Testing: Extensive use of TDD to ensure reliable and bug-free code.

# Technologies Used
Java: The primary programming language used for developing the application.
JUnit: A testing framework for implementing TDD.
